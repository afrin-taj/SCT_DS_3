This notebook analyzes a bank marketing dataset. It builds a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit ('y' column) based on various customer attributes. The notebook then evaluates the model's performance using a classification report, and visualizes the decision tree and some feature distributions.
